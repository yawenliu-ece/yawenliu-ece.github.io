About me
------ 
I am a third year PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University. Currently, I am based at the WiTech Lab in Pittsburgh, PA, working with Prof. Swarun Kumar (fall 2022-present) on millimeter-wave sensing, wireless RF systems and next-generation communication, with a focus on metamaterial surface design. 

I hold a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and a B.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the University of Southern California. During my time at USC, I was advised by Prof. Heather Culberston (spring 2020-spring 2023), Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari (fall 2021-spring 2022), and Prof. Constantine Sideris (spring 2021-spring 2022).

Research Interests
------ 
* Wireless sensing and communication systems
* Smart material waveguides and antenna design for enhanced wireless coverage
* Millimeter Wave/THz Sensing
* Radio Frequency (RF) integrated circuits and systems
* Metamaterial Surface
