We presented MetaMorph, a novel application of the existing inflatable robots for wireless communication systems by forming a shape-programming, reflective waveguide that enhances the received signal quality for wireless devices. This extra geometry flexibility enables better adaptability to multipath changes, as in the environments or transmitter locations. For example, thick of a temporary construction site might block the long-range communication signal path and drain a small IoT device's battery quickly for more retransmission attempts. This proposes This repository hosts files including simulation, fabrication, and control circuits to investigate the design of the reflector.
