excerpt: >
    A simple soda can can act as a directional reflector to improve wireless signal strength by focusing energy toward one direction. But what if such reflective surfaces were shape-programmable and able to adapt to environmental changes? We introduce MetaMorph, a shape-programmable reflective waveguide built using inflatable robotic structures to enhance wireless reception. By dynamically adjusting its geometry, MetaMorph adapts to multipath variations and changes in transmitter location. This adaptability helps maintain reliable links in situations where temporary obstructions—such as construction—would otherwise degrade signal quality and force small IoT devices to waste energy on retransmissions.
